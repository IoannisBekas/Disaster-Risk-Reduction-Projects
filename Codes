PROJECT 1 Tropical Storm Forming
This project utilizes a logistic regression model to predict the probability of tropical storm formation within the next 7 days. The model takes in key meteorological variables such as mean sea level pressure, sea surface temperature, wind speed, and humidity, along with lag features (previous week's pressure and temperature) to improve predictive accuracy. The dataset is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and evaluated using confusion matrices and classification reports. The model assigns risk alerts (Green, Yellow, Orange, Red) based on probability thresholds.
Goals:
Provides an early warning system for tropical storms, allowing timely disaster preparedness.
Enhances data-driven decision-making for deploying resources to high-risk regions.
Reduces economic and human loss by enabling preemptive evacuations and resource mobilization.

PROJECT 2 Drought Risk Forecasting
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a specialized form of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed for time-series forecasting. It generates and processes synthetic weather data (temperature, rainfall, soil moisture) to predict a drought index. The model leverages window-based feature engineering to create temporal dependencies, applies dropout regularization to prevent overfitting, and uses Adam optimization for efficient training. The model is then saved and can be deployed as a Flask API for real-time inference.
Goals:
Enhances drought early warning systems (EWS) by providing dynamic risk assessments.
Supports climate adaptation policies by identifying long-term trends in water scarcity.
Facilitates humanitarian planning by predicting water stress and food insecurity risks.

PROJECT 3 Flood Risk Prediction System
This project develops a custom multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network using TensorFlow to assess flood risk. It processes environmental variables like rainfall, soil moisture, river levels, temperature, and region elevation to classify whether a flood is likely to occur. Unlike traditional ML models, this implementation does not rely on Keras but instead manually constructs neural network layers using tf.Module and tf.Variables. It includes a manual training loop with GradientTape for optimizing the modelâ€™s parameters.
Goals:
Provides automated flood risk assessments for disaster-prone areas.
Aids in flood mitigation planning by identifying high-risk zones in real time.
Improves disaster response coordination by integrating with geographic information systems (GIS) for spatial risk mapping.
