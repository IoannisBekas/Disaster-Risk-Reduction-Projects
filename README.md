# Disaster-Risk-Reduction-Projects (UNDRR) - by BEKAS Ioannis


This repository contains a collection of AI-driven projects designed to support disaster risk reduction (DRR) efforts. These projects leverage machine learning and deep learning to predict and mitigate the impact of extreme weather events such as tropical storms, droughts, and floods. By utilizing data-driven approaches, these models provide early warning systems (EWS) to aid decision-makers in disaster preparedness, mitigation, and response. Each project focuses on a specific disaster scenario, incorporating predictive modeling, feature engineering, and real-world deployment strategies.


Project 1 Tropical Storm Forming: Predicts tropical storm formation within the next 7 days using a logistic regression model. Technology Stack: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Project 2 Drought Risk Forecasting: Predicts drought risk using time-series deep learning (LSTM model) trained on environmental data. Technology Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Flask, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas

Project 3 Flood Risk Prediction System: Uses a custom neural network (MLP) built in TensorFlow to assess flood probability based on meteorological and hydrological factors. Technology Stack: Python, TensorFlow (low-level API), NumPy, Pandas
